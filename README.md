# WebGL2Tex
A simple library for OOP encapsulation and abstraction of some of the different WebGL2 textures.

There's the `Texture.Base` class which is the base for the other classes which currently are: <br/>
`Texture.T2D`: 2D WebGL textures <br/>
`Texture.T3D`: 3D WebGL textures <br/>

Check to code and the WebGL documentation for the parameters needed.

Pair this up with other code that uses WebGL in order to get access to a more types of textures without having to deal with WebGL being WebGL :D

To use this library you can simply include https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/RandomGamingDev/WebGL2Tex/tex.js in your HTML file! If you want to you can also just download the file and include it in your HTML file that way.

btw stuff updates so remember to specify a version/commit for your library if you want to use a link and don't want your code to automatically update to the newest version of the library
